# Simple IoT Stock Management System
This project demonstrates an IoT-based stock management system using Node.js microservices, Node-RED, and AWS EC2. It monitors stock levels in real time and automatically triggers deliveries and alerts when stock is low.

## Features
- Node.js microservices: stock-api, delivery, and alerts
- Node-RED dashboard for real-time monitoring and control
- Secure AWS deployment with restricted access rules
- Scalability tested through simulated store activity

## Technologies Used
Node.js, Node-RED, AWS EC2, REST APIs
